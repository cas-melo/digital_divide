                <p>The Central African Republic (CAR) is the country in which the digital divide is most prominent, characterized by an extremely low internet penetration rate (11%) as of 2024. With limited infrastructure development about broadband access and high costs of internet access relative to income, connectivity remains a challenge, particularly in rural and remote areas within the CAR. This internet disparity, coupled with the notably low number of the population that has access to a computer (&lt;1%), significantly impacts education, economic opportunities, and social connectivity within the country. Students struggle to access online educational resources, hindering their learning. In addition, small businesses face obstacles in accessing online markets, constraining economic growth and entrepreneurship. Socially, the lack of internet connectivity isolates communities within the CAR from the global community, hindering communication with friends, family, and diaspora communities.</p>

                <p>It's time to take action. The digital divide in the Central African Republic and other underserved, impoverished, and/or rural areas around the world cannot be ignored any longer. Lack of internet access and digital resources is severely impacting education, economic opportunities, and social connectivity for millions of people.</p>
                <p>We must:</p>
                <ul class="case-study-list">
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Invest in Infrastructure</span>: Prioritize building and upgrading broadband networks.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Subsidize Internet Costs</span>: Implement programs to make internet access affordable for low-income households.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Promote Digital Literacy</span>: Establish educational initiatives to teach digital skills in schools and communities.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Encourage Public-Private Partnerships</span>: Work with private companies to provide technology and internet services.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Create Inclusive Policies</span>: Develop and enforce policies that promote equal access to technology for all.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By understanding and addressing the digital divide, we can work towards a more inclusive digital society where everyone can benefit from advancements in technology.</p>
